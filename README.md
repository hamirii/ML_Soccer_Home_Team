# Soccer_Classification_MachineLearning

A simple machine learning project using Tensor Flow that does two things:

1. (Not involving TF) - A simple function that takes in a DataFrame database (in this case, the data of all games played in the Serie A Italian Football League 2018/19 season) and outputs the number of Home Wins, Away Wins, and Draws in the league that season

2. Using a database of various features (goals scored, shots taken, etc.), the program determines whether a team is a "home team" or an "away team" based on their performances.
