# TensorFlow-SoccerTeam-Classifier-ML

A simple machine learning project using Tensor Flow that does two things:

1. (Not involving TF) - A simple function that takes in a DataFrame database (in this case, the data of all games played in the Serie A Italian Football League 2018/19 season) and outputs the number of Home Wins, Away Wins, and Draws in the league that season

2. Using a database of various features, the program decides whether the Home Team will win or not (loss counts as a draw), based on a variety of parameters including shots on target, fouls, and yellow/red cards given. The goals scored by home and away sides, as well as the full time result and half time result data was 'dropped' from the dataset. Wouldn't want to make it too easy now, would we? :)
