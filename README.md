# TensorFlow-SoccerTeam-Classifier-ML

A simple machine learning project using Tensor Flow that does two things:

1. (Not involving TF) - A simple function that takes in a DataFrame database (in this case, the data of all games played in the Serie A Italian Football League 2018/19 season) and outputs the number of Home Wins, Away Wins, and Draws in the league that season

2. Using a database of various features (goals scored, shots taken, etc.), the program decides whether the Home Team will win or lose, based on a variety of parameters including shots on target, fouls, and yellow/red cards given.

Will be modifying this code later to do the same thing, only determine if the winning team is a Home team or an Away team!
